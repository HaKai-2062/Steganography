# Steganography Tool

## Note
- This tool was made only for educational purposes. I will not be responsible for any damage that it may cause.

## How it works?
Steganography involves hiding data (mostly text) into an image file secretly to keep confidentiality of the message.

It works on the principle of least significant bit manipulation technique and data is stored (in last 2 bits of rgb) sequentially without any encryption so it is quite easy to infer what is hidden.

> Currently, only 24 bit bitmap (bmp) is supported as they are the easiest to work with.

## Tools used
- Visual Studio 2022
